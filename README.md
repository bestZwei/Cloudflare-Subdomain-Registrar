## Step 2: Configuring `config.php`

### 1. Database Configuration

define('DOMAIN_NAME', 'example.com');           // Lowercase version
define('DOMAIN_NAME_UP', 'EXAMPLE.COM');        // Uppercase version
define('REGISTRAR_DOMAIN', 'registrar.example.com');  // Domain of the registrar system
```

```php
define('CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY', 'your-cloudflare-api-token');
define('CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID', 'your-cloudflare-zone-id');
```
Get API Token From [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
Find your zone ID on the Overview tab for your domain in the Cloudflare dashboard.
